Version Control
---------------
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.

Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. 


Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database

If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.


Advantages of Version Control:

1. A complete long-term change history of every file
2. Branching and Merging
3. Traceability.


Types of Version Control Systems
--------------------------------
1. Centralized Version Control

A centralized version control system relies on a central server where developers commit changes. Users like centralized systems, because theyâ€™re simple to set up and provide admins with workflow controls. 

eg> Subversion, CVS, and Perforce etc.,


2. Distributed Version Control
Distributed Version Control is a version control where each client can have same copy of source code as server has and both server and client maintain history of source code.

Eg> Mercurial, Git and Bazaar etc.,
