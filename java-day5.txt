Agenda
------

1. Collections 
     LIST
	 SET
     Queue
	 Map

2. Streams (Collection Streams -- java8)

3. Method References, Joda Date API


List
----
1. It is linear in structure
2. Elements are access through its index
3. Duplicate elements are allowed
4. Null values are also allowed
5. Insertion order is maintained

Array ---> ArrayList
Linked list ---> LinkedList




Methods of Collection interface
-------------------------------

1	public boolean add(E e)	
It is used to insert an element in this collection.

2	public boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)	
It is used to insert the specified collection elements in the invoking collection.

3	public boolean remove(Object element)	
It is used to delete an element from the collection.

4	public boolean removeAll(Collection<?> c)	
It is used to delete all the elements of the specified collection from the invoking collection.

5	default boolean removeIf(Predicate<? super E> filter)	
It is used to delete all the elements of the collection that satisfy the specified predicate.

6	public boolean retainAll(Collection<?> c)	
It is used to delete all the elements of invoking collection except the specified collection.

7	public int size()	
It returns the total number of elements in the collection.

8	public void clear()	
It removes the total number of elements from the collection.

9	public boolean contains(Object element)	
It is used to search an element.


ar ={1,2,3,4}
ar.contains(2);//true
ar.contains(5);false

ar1 = {3,4}

ar.contains(ar1); //true


10	public boolean containsAll(Collection<?> c)	
It is used to search the specified collection in the collection.

11	public Iterator iterator()	
It returns an iterator.


To Travese the objects inside a collection
------------------------------------------

12	public Object[] toArray()	
It converts collection into array.

13	public <T> T[] toArray(T[] a)	
It converts collection into array. Here, the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.

14	public boolean isEmpty()	
It checks if collection is empty.

15	default Stream<E> stream()	
It returns a sequential Stream with the collection as its source.

16	public boolean equals(Object element)	
It matches two collections.

17	public int hashCode()	
It returns the hash code number of the collection.
