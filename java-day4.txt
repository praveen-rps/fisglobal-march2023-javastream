Object class
------------

Object class is parent class of all the classes
in java, including user defined classes 

Methods in Object class
-----------------------
1. public final Class getClass()	
2. public int hashCode()
3. public String toString()
4. public boolean equals(Object obj)
5. protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException

6. public final void notify()
7. public final void notifyAll()

8. public final void wait(long timeout)throws InterruptedException
9. public final void wait(long timeout,int nanos)throws 	InterruptedException
10. public final void wait()throws InterruptedException

11. protected void finalize() throws Throwable

Garbage Collection
------------------

It will automatically, cleans or removes the unused objects
in the memory.

Exception Handling
-------------------
It is the process of handling the runtime errors

when we run a program, we may get two types of erros
1. compile time  -- will occur due to wrong syntax of prog lang
2. runtime  -- Hard to determine there are plenty of reasons to occur

1. file not found
2. memory not sufficient
3. permission is not available

s1
s2
s3  open f1.txt // runtime error

s4  read the contents
s5		display on monitor

The exceptions which are direct descendts or children are called
checked exceptions

and the exceptions which are descends to Runtime Exception are 
called unchecked exceptions

checked exception will make the programmer to explcitly handle
it using exception handling mechanism

unchecked exception will not mandate for exception handling
mechanism


try{
// which will contain the code for error prones

}
catch(IOException ){
// block will contain error handling code

}
finally{
// which will always execute irrespective of error occurs or not

}
next statements


when there is no exception
try ----> finally ----> continue exection after finally

when there is an exception
--------------------------
try---> catch ---> finally ----> continue execution after finally

when there is an exception,	

try ---> finally ---> stop execution

throws  ----> it is used to make the code compild when a checked
exception is not handled in the program

exception is thrown to  calling place


throw----> used to throw the exception explicitly


try{
		int a=10/0;
}
catch(IOException e)
{

}

Throw is basically used in creating userdefined exceptions


int 

balance=5000;
balance=4999; 

1. we have to create our own exeption
2. we have to explictly mention the condition
3. we have to explicity rais the exception when that condition
is met

Steps to create user defined exception

1. create a sub class to either exception class or runtimeexception
2. pass the description of sub class throuh super() method
3. write the condition
4. raise the condition and handle it

age > 100 or age <0  ---> InvalidAgeException
age >=0 and age <=17 ----> InsufficentAgeException
age >=18 and age <=100 ---> sufficient to vote


Usecase
-------

notemanagement create two packages called model and service


1. create a class called "Note" with below variables;
   noteId, author, title, description---String

1001,praveen,java,object oriented lang
1002,kumar,dotnet,simple ui lang
1003,satish,ms,best arch style

deleteNote(1005);


class Note{
private String noteId;
private String author;
private String title;
private String description;

public void setNoteId(String noteId){
		this.noteId=noteId;
}
public String getNoteId(){
		return noteId;
}


}

Note note = new Note();
note.noteId=1001;// error
note.setNoteId(1001);// valid
sop(note.getNoteId());//valid

setXXX()
getXXX()




note class should be created in "model" package

2. create an interface called NoteService with the crud operations for the
   above Note Object

interface NoteService{

	public void createNote(Note note);
	public void readNote();
	public void updateNote(Note note);
	public void deleteNotes(String noteId);

}

3. implement NoteService in another class called "NoteServiceImpl"

NoteService and NoteServiceImpl must be created in "service" pacakge


4. create class as NoteController in controller package
create a public static void main program

create an object for NoteServiceImpl notes

5. create a menu based approach to read the choice 

1. create note
2. delete note
3. update note
4. display note
enter your choice1
notes.createNote(null);

notes.deleteNotes(null);



6. create user defined exceptions called

 6.1 InvalidNoteIdException
 6.2 InvalidNoteException
above execeptions must be created in exceptions pacakge

Multithreading
---------------
Multitasking--The ability to do multiple tasks simultenously

Is the process of simultenously executing parts of the same program

s1
s2	
s3

s4
s5
s6
the simple part which is executing is called thread
process under execution is called thread
thread is a light weight


t1-----> t2 (wait)  t2.wait()
t1.notify()---> t2 will get notified and activated

t3---> t4 t4.wait()
t3.notify()---> t4 will get notified and activated

t1.notifyAll() ----> t2 and t4 all will  get activated


threads are created with priorities

1 to 10 (1 min and 10 max)

by default all threads will have priority of 5

In java thread can be created in two ways:

1. Thread class -- All thread management methods

2. Runnable Interface

Methods in Thread class
------------------------
1. public void run(){
 
  }

2. public void start()

3. public int getPriority()
4. public void setPriority(int prirority);
getName()
setName()
currentThread()
getId()
isAlive()
join()
yield()
isDeamon()
setDeamon()
isInterrupted()
interrupted()

synchronization()

s1
s2
s3
synchronize{
s4;
s5;
}
s6;
s7;

t1---> s1
t2---> s1


 synchronize public void getDetails(){


}


synchronize Object obj;
t1(obj)

t2 --> has to wait
t2(obj)  

Collection
----------
It is represenation of group of elements as a single entity
It is a dynamic object
